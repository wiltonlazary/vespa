/**
 * Packets of this type may be used to send simple control signals
 * between components in the application. Control packets only contain
 * a single unsigned integer. This integer denotes the type of control
 * packet. The effect of a control packet depends on the packet
 * context it is delivered in. Control packets are also special in
 * that the Free method is overridden to do nothing. This means that
 * control packets must be deleted explicitly, which correlates nicely
 * with their static nature (you only need one instance of each type
 * of control packet). Control packets are mainly used for FNET
 * related signals and events, but the application is free to use the
 * control packets defined by FNET for it's own purposes. It may also
 * define it's own control packets as long as the command values are
 * greater than or equal to 5000. Note that control packets may NOT be
 * sent across the network.
