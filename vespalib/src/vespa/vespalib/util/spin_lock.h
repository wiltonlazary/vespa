/**
 * A spin-lock implementation that favors uncontended performance.
 * Some measures are taken to reduce the impact of threads waiting to
 * get the lock since this will not affect the fast-path of obtaining
 * the lock immediately.
 *
 * Note that multiple threads trying to obtain the lock at the same
 * time will reduce performance due to atomic writes against the same
 * cache line.
 *
 * Note that being preempted while holding the lock will reduce
 * performance, even more if the thread holding the lock is lower
 * priority than the threads trying to obtain the lock. With a
 * deterministic scheduler this could even lead to deadlock.
 *
 * This implementation satisfies the BasicLockable requirements,
 * making it work with things like std::lock_guard.
